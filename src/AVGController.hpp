/*
 * This class is the controller for the game
 *
 * Although one could, using Text to Speech API, such
 * as the one provided by Microsoft, to add in various
 * background stories; For the purpose of this project
 * we set the background to be 'Post-Modern Robotics
 * Era', where the player's role is a robotics scientist
 * And his goal is to collect N power rings - known as
 * "The Rings Of the Infinite Energy"
 * He also has an enemy, a robot that he built that has
 * become so intelligent, that it realized the importance
 * of the power rings, and is also trying to collect them
 * in order to give robots infinite energy and rule the
 * earth
 *
 * This adventure game is like those text adventure game,
 * where you need to walk around, and explore. But the
 * messages are provided in a Audio fashion - you hear it.
 * With Myo, it is even more enjoyable, because you can
 * just sit back and close your eyes, and use your brain
 * to imagine, and reason, and play the game.
 *
 * Story is designed by Kaiyu Zheng
